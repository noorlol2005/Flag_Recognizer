# Flag_Recognizer 🏳️🏴🇵🇰
This is a small python app that recognizes flags and flag emojis by their features. You give it characteristics of the flag and it gives you the flag name and emoji OR you can give it the flag emoji and it will give you the name of flag. So far it's limited to South Asia only but I plan on extending it.
